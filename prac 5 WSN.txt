practical 5 WSN RIP and OSPF
require things
6 PC, 3 switch pt, 3 router pt

connect all pc, switch and router through wired

After connecting all the components. Now comes the config part

pc configuration:
for 192.168.10.0
pc > config > fastetnernet > 192.168.10.2 
pc > config > fastetnernet > 192.168.10.3

for 192.168.11.0
pc > config > fastetnernet > 192.168.11.2 
pc > config > fastetnernet > 192.168.11.3

for 192.168.12.0
pc > config > fastetnernet > 192.168.12.2 
pc > config > fastetnernet > 192.168.12.3

router configration router to switch
for 192.168.10.0
router > config > fastetnernet 0/0 > 192.168.10.1

for 192.168.11.0
router > config > fastetnernet 0/0 > 192.168.11.1

for 192.168.12.0
router > config > fastetnernet 0/0 > 192.168.12.1

router to router coniguration
before configuring the router to router path check the router to router connection by hovering your upon the smaller triangle. According to that configure the router
for 10.0.0.0
1st router
router > config > serial > 10.0.0.2
2nd router
router > config > serial > 10.0.0.3

for 11.0.0.0
1st router
router > config > serial > 11.0.0.2
2nd router
router > config > serial > 11.0.0.3

for 12.0.0.0
1st router
router > config > serial > 12.0.0.2
2nd router
router > config > serial > 12.0.0.3

1) RIP METHOD
For RIP method we will go to each router set RIP by adding every network gateways
router > config > RIP 
add all the network gateway
10.0.0.0
11.0.0.0
12.0.0.0
192.168.10.0
192.168.11.0
192.168.12.0

After doing this, send packets from one pc to another pc
do this one or more time for successful output

2) OSPF method
In rip method, you have gone to rip tab and add all the network gateway but for ospf you have to add network gateway through command line
Router > CLI
then enter this command:

router ospf 1
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0
network 11.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0
network 12.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0

for better understanding what does above code means
router ospf 1 => this code is used for starting ospf method
network 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 => this code is used for creating connection: network = establish connection, 192.168.10.0 = network gateway
0.0.0.255 = wildcard masking 
wildcard masking is different from subnet
in subnet for 192.168.10.0 the subnet will be 255.255.255.0 but for wildcard masking, it will be 0.0.0.255 which means the part in ip address which have 0 will became 255 and which have number 1-255 will became 0

now here comes the state where the router will be not configure terminal state. So for this we will type this method.
command:
enable
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 192.168.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0
network 11.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0
network 12.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0

that's all you will have the first two command then rest are same.

After doing this, send packets from one pc to another pc
do this one or more time for successful output
